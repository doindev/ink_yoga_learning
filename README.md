## üìö Key Concepts Summary

### Ink Fundamentals

**What it is:** A React renderer that outputs to the terminal instead of the DOM.

**Key points:**
- Write familiar React code
- Uses components, hooks, and JSX
- Renders via ANSI escape codes
- Powered by Yoga for layout

**Basic usage:**
```typescript
import { render, Box, Text } from 'ink';
render(<Box><Text>Hello!</Text></Box>);
```

---

### Yoga Layout

**What it is:** A cross-platform flexbox layout engine (same as React Native).

**Key points:**
- Implements CSS Flexbox spec
- Calculates positions automatically
- Two-axis system (main + cross)
- Responsive and predictable

**Core properties:**
- `flexDirection`: row or column
- `justifyContent`: main axis alignment
- `alignItems`: cross axis alignment
- `flexGrow`: space distribution
- `padding`: internal spacing
- `margin`: external spacing

---

### The Box Component

**What it is:** Your fundamental layout container (like `<div>` in HTML).

**Every Box:**
- Has flexbox properties
- Can contain other Boxes
- Can have borders and padding
- Is laid out by Yoga

**Example:**
```typescript
<Box 
  flexDirection="column"
  justifyContent="center"
  padding={2}
  borderStyle="round"
>
  {children}
</Box>
```
