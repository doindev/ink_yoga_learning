Intentionally break code to see what happens. Learn from errors.

### 4. Experiment Constantly
The playground is there for a reason. Use it frequently.

### 5. Build Projects
Apply knowledge immediately. Build small CLI tools.

### 6. Read Comments
Code comments explain the "why" behind the "what".

### 7. Revisit Lessons
Go through lessons multiple times. You'll notice new details.

### 8. Take Notes
Write down key concepts in your own words.

### 9. Teach Others
The best way to solidify knowledge is teaching someone else.

### 10. Have Fun
Enjoy the process! Building terminal UIs is creative and rewarding.
